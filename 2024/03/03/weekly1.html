<p>Well, another week has passed. I feel that since the BIBIFI project was completed, I have had less energy for programming or other learning activities. I’m not willing to examine the solution for pthread programming, nor am I motivated to work on leetcode.</p>

<p>I can hardly wake up; usually, it is past 12 pm, not to mention early in the morning. Even though I am able to drive to campus, how can I attend there on time? Not to say that I need to take the road test later next week, and I cannot drive by then.</p>

<p>Vancouver is such a nice place to live. But why do I feel that I fear spending time relaxing and walking around? What am I waiting for? I will stay at home and do nothing, barely looking at the screen, rarely reading a book, wasting my time.</p>

<p>Although I have made myself tough on that breakup, the past, the thing we did together, and the words are still haunting me. I can’t count how many hours I spend each day recalling those mischiefs. <em>“The eyes, chico, they never lie.”</em></p>

<p>You need to change…</p>

<p>Nevermind, here are some songs that I played a lot in this week.</p>
