<p>It has been two weeks since my last weekly. First, I passed the knowledge and road test of my BC driver license.
Quite a suprise that the process has been smooth to me because many of my friends have failed in their first road test.
Even though I can only apply for a novice license, I feel much relieved since I’ve no longer needed to worry about that
I cannot use my Chinese one after graduation.
Besides getting my license, I really need to make extra obeservation on the road while driving after a near miss.</p>

<p>Thinking about my graduation next month, I really need to be serious on this. A sudden change on BC PNP has been
announced this Tuesday. Although I’m not affected by that new policy, it still make me to reflect on myself that
how I can improve myself to adapt the life here after one year and half since my first arrival. A lot of students
who are affected went to a protest this Saturday. It elicited a lot confusion and barrel in between international 
students, residents and netizens. Since this is a privileged pathway, I have to say I am lucky and I should never
rely on these in my future. Sometimes it is too good to be true. A friend of mine has been low in mood this week.
I wish her can be happy in the future. She liked the songs I shared to her. People are superficial here, I need to
avoid becoming them.</p>

<p>Last Sunday I went to English beach to see the sunset. It healed my tiredness throughout the week. 
It is blessed that last Sunday, this Sunday and next Sunday are sunny.
My cousin was accepted by his target medical school, congrats.</p>
