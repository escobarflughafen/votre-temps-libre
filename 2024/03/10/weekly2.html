<p>A good friend of mine came back to Vancouver recently. I picked him up at the airport and we had a great reunion meal - Pho 99 on North Road.</p>

<p>On Friday morning, I tried to do delivery and it went very well - orders were coming one after another and tipped well. Will do another morning shift on Monday next week (one day before I hand in my license to ICBC). I have saved a lot on gas spending by the recent promotion of Air Miles (60 Miles rewarded when redeeming 95 Miles for $10, and two times a day from 8th to 14th).</p>

<p>First time for me to visit SFU Surrey campus, nice and clean, though, the neighbourhoods are sketchy. It is kinda like the <em>Wanshengwei Station</em>.</p>

<p>I haven’t done much work in this week. However, in the next week, I will take the driving license test and wish to get the license as soon as possible.
Also, renew my passport for the incoming PGWP application. Hope I will get a Canadian one within 5 years.</p>

<p>Talking to her came to a block that I feel that I am too dull or awkward in replies and she said I behaved like a robot， <em>“Hi, Siri”</em>. No rizz for me. I wish I could be there one day or she would come. Need to find more interesting topics, or, delve our talk into a deeper context.</p>

<p>Here are some songs I’ve played all along this week,</p>
