A good friend of mine came back to Vancouver recently. I picked him up at the airport and we had a great reunion meal - Pho 99 on North Road.

On Friday morning, I tried to do delivery and it went very well - orders were coming one after another and tipped well. Will do another morning shift on Monday next week (one day before I hand in my license to ICBC). I have saved a lot on gas spending by the recent promotion of Air Miles (60 Miles rewarded when redeeming 95 Miles for $10, and two times a day from 8th to 14th).

First time for me to visit SFU Surrey campus, nice and clean, though, the neighbourhoods are sketchy. It is kinda like the *Wanshengwei Station*.

I haven't done much work in this week. However, in the next week, I will take the driving license test and wish to get the license as soon as possible.
Also, renew my passport for the incoming PGWP application. Hope I will get a Canadian one within 5 years.

Talking to her came to a block that I feel that I am too dull or awkward in replies and she said I behaved like a robot， *“Hi, Siri”*. No rizz for me. I wish I could be there one day or she would come. Need to find more interesting topics, or, delve our talk into a deeper context. 

Here are some songs I've played all along this week,

- [*Venus as a Boy* - Björk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaxUZH0cbhM&ab_channel=CruiseControl)
- [*Pap-Pi-Doo-Bi-Doo-Ba 物語* - Ohtaki Eiichi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OEoJvphEME&ab_channel=ThomasCradden) - She liked this!
- [*COSMIC SURFIN' - YMO*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgACAdw_K2I&ab_channel=Doyouknow%3F)
